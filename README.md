Welcome to Bamazon 
This is a simple way to pull data from a database that I created and allow the user to put in the ID of 
the product they want to buy. 
It will display the table of products asking the user what they would like.

If the product is in stock it will tell them how many is left and will ship to the user.

If there is none is stock it will tell the user to get lost.
